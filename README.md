Bash Shenanigans
================

A collection of tools one can write in bash but probably shouldn't.

# BIND zonefile checker

Cursed Bash script for checking syntax + serial increment of BIND zonefiles.
Intended for use with GitLab CI.

# mkflashimage

Simple tool to construct flash images from single, per partition files.

Can also perform reverse operation, deconstructing a flash image into its partitions

Does not require Bash, runs on any POSIX shell
